##  How I'll be spending my 2024 summer

<Image src={golang} />

### Introduction

After a long year of pressure, hard work, and burnout, I have finally finished my 2nd year of university and I am ready to enjoy my summer the way
I want to. I have been planning for this summer for a long time and I am excited to share my plans with you.

### My daily routine

I have bought two udemy courses from <a href="https://www.husseinnasser.com/p/about-hussein.html" target='_blank' >Hussein Nasser</a>. One for the fundamentals of backend engineering
and one for the fundamentals of database engineering.

The courses both will take me around 18 hours each to complete, and I am willing to watch an hour worth of courses everyday and apply them on my own projects.

I will also be heading to the gym to work out as I have been slacking for the past year and I am not happy with my current body shape.

### My projects
I will be building a Pseudocode compiler using <a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank">GO</a>. It will be the perfect chance to learn about GO and how to build a compiler, I belive this will
be an utterly unique project on my resume that would make me standout infront of recruiters, it is not your typical netflix clone.

My short term career goal is to land an internship at <a href="https://www.instabug.com" target='_blank'>Instabug</a> next summer, and after a very humbling assessment experience,
I will make sure to be the best candidate for the job next year.
