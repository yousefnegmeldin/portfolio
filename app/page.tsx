      <p>I&apos;m a 2nd year student at the <Anchor link="www.giu-uni.de" text="German International University"/> in Egypt. 
      I believe in simplicity and the power of small things such as a smile or a simple web app. My passion for technology, web development, and tech, in general, has led me to choose to pursue my career in software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>My first ever encounter with coding was in 2017 where I bought a udemy course and never finished it, in fact I gived up half way because I could not understand anything.
        But here I am, a few years later, proficient in many programming languages and frameworks such as React, Node.js, Java, and Python. I have also worked on many projects, some of which are available on my GitHub profile.
